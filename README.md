# my-tv-shows-status

A project made for fun and as an excuse to learn Vue.js

I like to keep track of my favorite tv shows on a text file, so i decided to build this web application instead of continuing to update the boring text files.

## The main technologies used are:

* Vue.js with Vue Loader and Vue Router
* Sass Preprocessor
* webpack

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run your MongoDB server

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 & localhost:3000
npm run dev-client or npm run dev-server

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
