# my-tv-shows-status

A project made for fun and as an excuse to learn Vue.js <img width="16" src="/build/logo.png" alt="Vue.js logo">

I like to keep track of my favorite tv shows on a text file, so i decided to build this web application instead of continuing to update the boring text files.

## The main technologies used are:

* Vue.js with Vue Loader and Vue Router
* Sass Preprocessor (using scss)
* webpack
* localStorage (when i will learn some back end this will be replaced)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
